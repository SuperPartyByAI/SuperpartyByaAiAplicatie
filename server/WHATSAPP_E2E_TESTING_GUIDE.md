# WhatsApp E2E Testing Guide - "Cap-coadă" Flow

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for running the complete end-to-end test suite for the WhatsApp integration system.

## Prerequisites
- Firebase CLI installed and authenticated
- Access to Firebase Console (superparty-frontend project)
- Access to legacy hosting dashboard
- Flutter app installed and configured
- Test WhatsApp account (WA-01)

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Run Automated Tests (Recommended)
```bash
bash test-whatsapp-e2e-complete.sh
```

This will:
- Check for old 1st gen WhatsApp function
- Verify legacy hosting backend health
- Verify Firebase Functions availability
- Check Firestore rules protection
- Generate a test report with manual test instructions

### Option 2: Manual Step-by-Step

## Step 1: Cleanup Old Functions (If Needed)

**Check for old function:**
```bash
firebase functions:list | grep -i "whatsapp.*v1"
```

**If found:**
1. Go to Firebase Console → Project `superparty-frontend` → Functions
2. Filter by "1st gen"
3. Find function named `whatsapp`
4. Click Delete
5. Redeploy functions:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

## Step 2: Verify Platform Configuration

### legacy hosting Backend
```bash
curl -sS https://whats-app-ompro.ro/health
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "firestore": {
    "status": "connected"
  },
  "accounts": {
    "total": 0,
    "connected": 0,
    "max": 30
  }
}
```

**Verify legacy hosting Variables (in legacy hosting dashboard):**
- `SESSIONS_PATH=/app/sessions` ✅
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=...` ✅ (must be set)
- `ADMIN_TOKEN=...` (optional, if exists)
- **Single instance** (no scale-out) ✅

### Firebase Configuration
```bash
# List functions
firebase functions:list | grep -i whatsapp

# Expected functions:
# - whatsappProxyGetAccounts
# - whatsappProxyAddAccount
# - whatsappProxyRegenerateQr
# - whatsappProxyDeleteAccount
# - whatsappProxySend
# - whatsappExtractEventFromThread
```

**Verify secrets:**
```bash
firebase functions:secrets:access LEGACY_WHATSAPP_URL
firebase functions:secrets:access GROQ_API_KEY
```

**Verify Firestore rules:**
- Rules file exists: `firestore.rules`
- Contains "NEVER DELETE" for threads/messages/clients ✅

## Step 3: Manual Tests in Flutter App

### Test 1: Pair WhatsApp Account (QR)

**Steps:**
1. Open Flutter app
2. Navigate to: **WhatsApp → Accounts**
3. Tap **Add account**
4. Enter account ID: `WA-01`
5. QR code should display
6. On your phone: **WhatsApp → Settings → Linked devices → Link a device**
7. Scan the QR code from the app

### Test 3: Receive Message (Client → WA-01)

**Prerequisites:**
- WA-01 account is paired and connected
- You have access to a test phone number

**Steps:**

4. Find the thread for the test phone number
5. Open the thread (Chat screen)
6. Verify the message appears

**Expected Result:**

firebase firestore:get threads --limit 1

# Check message exists
firebase firestore:get threads/{threadId}/messages --limit 1
```

**Screenshot:**
- Chat screen showing received message

### Test 4: Send Message (WA-01 → Client)

**Steps:**
1. In Flutter app: Open Chat for a thread
2. Type a test message: "Test message from SuperParty app"
3. Tap Send
4. Wait 5-10 seconds
5. Verify on test phone: Message received

**Expected Result:**
- Message appears in chat immediately (optimistic update)
- Message status shows "sent" → "delivered" → "read" (if client reads)
- Client receives message on WhatsApp
- Message persists in Firestore

**Verify in Firestore:**
```bash
# Check outbox entry
firebase firestore:get outbox --limit 1

# Check message in thread
firebase firestore:get threads/{threadId}/messages --order-by timestamp --limit 1
```

**Screenshot:**
- Chat screen showing sent message with status

---

### Test 5: Restart Safety

**Prerequisites:**
- WA-01 is paired
- At least 2-3 messages sent/received

**Steps:**
1. Note current message count in app
2. Trigger legacy hosting restart (via legacy hosting dashboard: Redeploy)
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for restart
4. In Flutter app: Refresh accounts list
5. Verify:
   - Account still shows as `connected` (no QR required)
   - All previous messages still visible
   - Send a test message to verify it still works

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Account remains connected
- ✅ All messages persist
- ✅ No data loss
- ✅ Can send/receive after restart

**If messages received during restart:**
- They should appear after restart completes (pending messages)

**Screenshot:**
- Accounts screen showing connected status after restart
- Chat screen showing all messages intact

### Test 6: CRM Extract/Save/Ask AI

**Prerequisites:**
- Thread with conversation about an event/booking

- Draft event form appears with:
  - Data/ora (date/time)
  - Adresă (address)
  - Personaje (guests/people)
  - Sumă (amount)
- Fields pre-filled from conversation

**6b. Save Event:**
1. Review extracted data
2. Make corrections if needed

**Verify in Firestore:**
```bash
firebase firestore:get evenimente --order-by createdAt --limit 1
```

**6c. Verify Client Stats:**
1. Wait 10-30 seconds (for aggregateClientStats to run)
2. Check `clients/{phoneE164}` document

**Expected Result:**
- `eventsCount` incremented
- `lifetimeSpend` updated (if amount extracted)

**Verify in Firestore:**
```bash
firebase firestore:get clients/{phoneE164}
```

**6d. Ask AI:**
1. Navigate to **Client Profile** (for the phone number)
2. Tap **Ask AI**
3. Type: "câți bani a cheltuit clientul cu telefonul X"

   - Pair WA-01 through WA-30
   - Checkpoint every 5 accounts:
     - Health check
     - Send/receive test
     - Verify connected status

2. **Monitor Production:**
   - Set up alerts for legacy hosting health
   - Monitor Firestore write operations
   - Track message delivery rates

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update user guide with pairing instructions
   - Document CRM extraction workflow
   - Create troubleshooting guide

## Support

If tests fail:
1. Check the generated test report
2. Review legacy hosting logs
3. Review Firebase Functions logs
4. Check Firestore rules and indexes
5. Verify all secrets are set correctly
