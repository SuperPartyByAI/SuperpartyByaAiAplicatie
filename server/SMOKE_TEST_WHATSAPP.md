📱 WhatsApp account ready
```

#### 1.3 First Restart

1. In legacy hosting Dashboard → Deployments
2. Click "Redeploy" on current deployment
3. Wait for restart (~2 minutes)
4. Check logs

**Expected Result:**

```
🔄 Restoring accounts from Firestore...
📦 Found 1 connected accounts in Firestore
✅ [account_XXX] Session restored from disk
✅ [account_XXX] Connected (no QR needed)
```

**❌ FAIL if:** QR code appears again

#### 1.4 Second Restart

## TEST 2: Reconnect Robustness

**Objective:** Verify exponential backoff and reconnect logic

### Steps:

#### 2.1 Simulate Network Disconnect

1. Turn off WiFi on WhatsApp mobile device
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Check legacy hosting logs

**Expected Result:**

```
⚠️ [account_XXX] Connection lost
🔄 [account_XXX] Attempting reconnect (attempt 1/5)
⏳ Backoff: 2 seconds
```

#### 2.2 Verify Backoff

1. Keep WiFi off
2. Observe logs for multiple retry attempts

**Expected Result:**

```
🔄 Attempt 1: backoff 2s
🔄 Attempt 2: backoff 4s
🔄 Attempt 3: backoff 8s
🔄 Attempt 4: backoff 16s
🔄 Attempt 5: backoff 32s
```

#### 2.3 Successful Reconnect

1. Turn WiFi back on
2. Wait for reconnection
3. Check logs

**Expected Result:**

```
✅ [account_XXX] Reconnected successfully
📱 WhatsApp account ready
```

### Pass Criteria:

- ✅ Exponential backoff observed (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s)
- ✅ Reconnects automatically when network returns
- ✅ No duplicate connections created
- ✅ Logs show clear disconnect reason

---

## TEST 3: Inbox Deduplication

**Objective:** Verify same message creates only ONE Firestore document

### Steps:

#### 3.1 Send Test Message

1. From WhatsApp mobile, send message to test account
2. Message: "TEST_DEDUP_001"
3. Wait 5 seconds
4. Check Firestore

**Expected Result:**

```
Firestore: threads/{threadId}/messages/{messageId}
- waMessageId: unique_id_from_baileys
- content: "TEST_DEDUP_001"
- timestamp: ...
```

#### 3.2 Simulate Duplicate Delivery

1. Check legacy hosting logs for message processing
2. Look for messageId

**Expected Result:**

```
📨 [account_XXX] PROCESSING: INBOUND message msg_abc123 from +40XXX
💾 [account_XXX] Saving to Firestore: threads/thread_123/messages/msg_abc123
✅ Message saved
```

#### 3.3 Verify No Duplicates

1. Query Firestore for messages with same content
2. Count documents

**Expected Result:**

- Only 1 document with content "TEST_DEDUP_001"
- Document ID = messageId from Baileys

### Pass Criteria:

- ✅ Same message = 1 Firestore document
- ✅ messageId is unique and deterministic
- ✅ No duplicate documents created

---

## TEST 4: Outbox Idempotency

**Objective:** Verify retry logic and status transitions

### Steps:

#### 4.1 Queue Test Message

```bash
# Create test message in wa_outbox
curl -X POST https://whats-app-ompro.ro/api/whatsapp/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": "+40XXXXXXXXX",
    "message": "TEST_OUTBOX_001"
  }'
```

**Expected Result:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "messageId": "msg_xyz789",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

#### 4.2 Verify Status Transition

1. Check Firestore `wa_outbox` collection
2. Find document with messageId
3. Observe status changes

**Expected Result:**

```
Initial: status = "queued"
After processing: status = "sent"
```

#### 4.3 Simulate Retry

1. Manually set status back to "queued" in Firestore
2. Wait for worker to process
3. Check status again

**Expected Result:**

```
Status: "queued" → "sent"
No duplicate messages sent
```

### Pass Criteria:

- ✅ Status transitions: queued → sent
- ✅ Retry doesn't create duplicate messages
- ✅ Idempotent processing (same message ID = same result)

---

## TEST 5: Client Data Persistence

**Objective:** Verify deterministic accountId and no duplicates

### Steps:

#### 5.1 Check Account ID Generation

1. Connect WhatsApp with phone: +40123456789
2. Check logs for accountId

**Expected Result:**

```
📱 Generated accountId: account_40123456789
```

#### 5.2 Restart and Verify Same ID

1. Redeploy application
2. Check logs for accountId

**Expected Result:**

```
📱 Restored accountId: account_40123456789
(Same ID as before)
```

#### 5.3 Check Firestore

1. Query `wa_accounts` collection
2. Count documents for this phone number

**Expected Result:**

- Only 1 document with accountId = account_40123456789
- No duplicates

### Pass Criteria:

- ✅ accountId is deterministic (same phone = same ID)
- ✅ No duplicate accounts in Firestore
- ✅ Account data persists across restarts

---

## TEST 6: Observability

**Objective:** Verify logs and health endpoint

### Steps:

#### 6.1 Check Health Endpoint

```bash
curl https://whats-app-ompro.ro/health
```

**Expected Result:**

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "commit": "fc48935c",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "accounts": {
    "total": 1,
    "connected": 1,
    "connecting": 0,
    "needs_qr": 0
  },
  "firestore": "connected"
}
```

#### 6.2 Verify Structured Logs

1. Open legacy hosting logs
2. Look for structured log format

**Expected Result:**

```
✅ [account_XXX] Connected
📨 [account_XXX] PROCESSING: INBOUND message
💾 [account_XXX] Saved to Firestore
⚠️ [account_XXX] Connection lost
🔄 [account_XXX] Attempting reconnect
```

#### 6.3 Check Cache Stats

```bash
curl https://whats-app-ompro.ro/api/cache/stats
```

**Expected Result:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "cache": {
    "enabled": true,
    "type": "redis",
    "connected": true
  }
}
```

### Pass Criteria:

- ✅ /health endpoint returns 200 OK
