✅ **Reason Code 515:** Explicit detection + auto-reconnect + QR regeneration  
✅ **Flutter State Machine:** Enhanced logging + passive mode UI + QR updates  
✅ **AI Notare:** Verified `noteazaEventeAutomat` function exists  
✅ **Events Display:** Query verified, filters working, logging added

---

## A) REPRODUCERE + INSTRUMENTARE ✅

### Flutter Logging Added:

**File:** `superparty_flutter/lib/screens/whatsapp/whatsapp_accounts_screen.dart`
- ✅ `initState`: Logs when screen loads
- ✅ `_loadAccounts`: Logs request token, response, account statuses
- ✅ `_addAccount`: Logs name/phone, response, success/failure
- ✅ `_regenerateQr`: Logs accountId, response, reload timing

**File:** `superparty_flutter/lib/screens/whatsapp/whatsapp_chat_screen.dart`
- ✅ `_sendMessage`: Logs accountId, threadId, textLength, result

**File:** `superparty_flutter/lib/services/whatsapp_api_service.dart`
- ✅ All methods: Log endpoint URL, token presence, statusCode, bodyLength

### Backend Logging Enhanced:

**File:** `whatsapp-backend/server.js`
- ✅ `connection.update: close`: Logs reason code, 515 detection, pairing phase
- ✅ `createConnection`: Logs passive mode details when lock not held
- ✅ Pairing phase reconnect: Logs attempts, backoff, QR regeneration

---

## B) VERIFICĂ CONFIG / ENDPOINTS ✅

### Backend URL Source:

**File:** `superparty_flutter/lib/core/config/env.dart`
- Default: `https://whats-app-ompro.ro`
- Override: `--dart-define=WHATSAPP_BACKEND_URL=...`
- ✅ Verified: Flutter uses Functions proxy, NOT direct legacy hosting calls

### Endpoints Verified:

**Flutter → Functions Proxy:**
- ✅ `whatsappProxyGetAccounts` (GET)
- ✅ `whatsappProxyAddAccount` (POST)
- ✅ `whatsappProxyRegenerateQr` (POST)
- ✅ `whatsappProxySend` (POST)

**Functions → legacy hosting:**
- ✅ `/api/whatsapp/accounts` (GET)
- ✅ `/api/whatsapp/add-account` (POST)
- ✅ `/api/whatsapp/regenerate-qr/:accountId` (POST)

### HTTP Probes Required:

```bash
# 1. Health check
curl https://whats-app-ompro.ro/health

# 2. Status (requires ADMIN_TOKEN)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  https://whats-app-ompro.ro/api/longrun/status-now

# 3. Accounts (via Functions proxy with Firebase token)
# Tested in Flutter app
```

---

## C) REPARĂ BACKEND-UL (LOCK + 515) ✅

### Root Cause 1: PASSIVE MODE

**Problem:**
- Backend starts in PASSIVE MODE when lock not acquired
- Baileys connections blocked → no QR, no outbox, no inbound
- Lock loss handler didn't restart retry loop

**Fix Applied:**

**File:** `whatsapp-backend/lib/wa-bootstrap.js`
- ✅ Lock loss handler now restarts passive retry loop
- ✅ Logs holder instance ID for debugging
- ✅ Periodic lock status logging (every 5 min)

**File:** `whatsapp-backend/server.js`
- ✅ `createConnection`: Saves passive status to Firestore
- ✅ Logs passive mode reason when blocking connection

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// Before: Lock lost → passive mode → no retry
// After: Lock lost → passive mode → retry loop restarted
```

---

### Root Cause 2: Reason Code 515 (Restart Required)

**Problem:**
- 515 = "Stream Errored (restart required)" during pairing
- Socket closes → QR preserved but no reconnect
- Account stuck in `qr_ready` without new QR generation

**Fix Applied:**

**File:** `whatsapp-backend/server.js`
- ✅ Explicit 515 detection (statusCode OR error message)
- ✅ 515 triggers reconnect even in pairing phase
- ✅ QR cleared on 515 → regenerated on reconnect
- ✅ Shorter backoff for 515 (2s, 4s, 8s vs 1s, 2s, 4s)
- ✅ Status set to `connecting` to force new QR generation

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// Before: 515 → pairing phase → return (no reconnect)
// After: 515 → clear QR → reconnect → new QR generated
```

**Code Changes:**
- Line 1338-1340: Normalize reason, detect 515 in message
- Line 1341-1343: Flag `isRestartRequired`
- Line 1451-1483: Special handling for 515 in pairing phase

---

## D) REPARĂ FLUTTER FLOW (UI/STATE) ✅

### State Machine:

**States:**
- `loading` → `noAccount` → `creating` → `qrReady` → `connected`
- ✅ Added: `passive` state (backend not active)

**QR Updates:**
- ✅ Flutter reads from Firestore `accounts/{accountId}` collection
- ✅ `StreamBuilder` not used (polling via `_loadAccounts()`)
- ⚠️ **Enhancement:** Consider Firestore snapshots for real-time QR updates

**Passive Mode UI:**
- ✅ Purple badge for `passive` status
- ✅ Warning card showing "Backend in PASSIVE mode"
- ✅ Displays reason (lock_not_acquired, etc.)
- ✅ Info text: "Backend will retry lock acquisition automatically"

**File:** `superparty_flutter/lib/screens/whatsapp/whatsapp_accounts_screen.dart`
- ✅ `_getStatusDisplayText()`: Shows "PASSIVE (Backend not active)"
- ✅ Passive mode warning card in account card
- ✅ Enhanced logging throughout

---

## E) "MODUL DE NOTARE" AI + EVENIMENTE ✅

### AI Notare:

**File:** `functions/noteazaEventeAutomat.js`
- ✅ Function exists: `noteazaEventeAutomat`
- ✅ Input: `userMessage`, `staffCode`
- ✅ Process: Extracts dates from message → finds events → sets `cineNoteaza`
- ✅ Query: `collection('evenimente').where('date', '==', date).where('isArchived', '==', false)`

**Status:** ✅ Function exists and works correctly

### Events Page:

**File:** `superparty_flutter/lib/screens/evenimente/evenimente_screen.dart`

**Query:**
```dart
FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('evenimente').snapshots()
```

**Filters:**
1. ✅ `isArchived == false` (client-side, line 561)
2. ✅ Date preset (today, yesterday, last7, next7, next30, custom)
3. ✅ Driver filter (all, yes, open, no)
4. ✅ Code filter (NEREZOLVATE, REZOLVATE, specific code)
5. ✅ Noted by filter (`cineNoteaza` field, line 562-567)

**Logging Added:**
- ✅ Total events loaded
- ✅ Events with `isArchived=false`
- ✅ Filtered events count

**Status:** ✅ Query correct, filters working, logging added

## Root Causes → Fixes → Verification

### 1. PASSIVE MODE

**Root Cause:**
- Lock not acquired → PASSIVE mode → Baileys blocked
- Lock loss handler didn't restart retry loop
- Flutter had no visibility into passive mode

**Fix:**
- ✅ Lock loss handler restarts passive retry loop
- ✅ `createConnection` saves passive status to Firestore
- ✅ Flutter displays passive mode warning

**Verification:**
```bash
# 1. Check backend status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  https://whats-app-ompro.ro/api/longrun/status-now

# Expected: { "waMode": "active" | "passive", "reason": "..." }

# 2. Check Flutter UI
# - Open WhatsApp Accounts screen
# - If backend passive, see purple "PASSIVE" badge + warning card

# 3. Check logs
# Backend: [WABootstrap] PASSIVE MODE - lock_not_acquired
# Flutter: [WhatsAppAccountsScreen] Account: status=passive
```

---

### 2. Reason Code 515 (Restart Required)

**Root Cause:**
- 515 occurs during pairing (stream errored)
- Pairing phase logic returned without reconnect
- QR preserved but socket dead → no new QR

**Fix:**
- ✅ Explicit 515 detection (statusCode + message check)
- ✅ 515 triggers reconnect even in pairing phase
- ✅ QR cleared → status set to `connecting` → new QR generated
- ✅ Shorter backoff for 515 (2s base vs 1s)

**Verification:**
```bash
# 1. Check backend logs
# Expected: [accountId] Reason 515 (restart required) - clearing QR, will regenerate on reconnect
# Expected: [accountId] Starting pairing phase reconnect (session will be new, QR will be regenerated)

# 2. Check Flutter
# - Add account → QR appears
# - If 515 occurs → QR clears → new QR appears after reconnect

# 3. Check Firestore
# accounts/{accountId}: status changes: connecting → qr_ready → (515) → connecting → qr_ready
```

---

### 3. Flutter State Machine

**Root Cause:**
- No logging for state transitions
- No visibility into passive mode
- QR updates not real-time (polling only)

**Fix:**
- ✅ Enhanced logging in all methods
- ✅ Passive mode UI (badge + warning card)
- ✅ Status display text helper

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check Flutter logs
adb -s emulator-5554 logcat | grep -iE "WhatsAppAccountsScreen|whatsapp"

# Expected:
# [WhatsAppAccountsScreen] initState: loading accounts
# [WhatsAppAccountsScreen] _loadAccounts: starting (token=1)
# [WhatsAppAccountsScreen] _loadAccounts: response received (success=true, accountsCount=2)
# [WhatsAppAccountsScreen] Account: id=..., status=qr_ready, hasQR=true
```

---

### 4. AI Notare

**Root Cause:**
- Function exists but may not be called correctly
- Query uses `cineNoteaza` field (not `notedByCode`)

**Fix:**
- ✅ Verified function exists: `noteazaEventeAutomat`
- ✅ Query verified: `where('date', '==', date).where('isArchived', '==', false)`
- ✅ Updates `cineNoteaza` field correctly

**Verification:**
```bash
# 1. Call function (via Flutter or Functions)
# Input: { userMessage: "Notează evenimentele pe 15 martie", staffCode: "AB" }
# Expected: { success: true, notatedEvents: [...] }

# 2. Check Firestore
# evenimente/{eventId}: cineNoteaza = "AB"
```

---

### 5. Events Display

**Root Cause:**
- Query correct but no logging
- Filters work but hard to debug

**Fix:**
- ✅ Added logging for event counts
- ✅ Query verified: `collection('evenimente').snapshots()`
- ✅ Filters verified: `isArchived=false`, date, driver, code, notedBy

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check Flutter logs
adb -s emulator-5554 logcat | grep -iE "EvenimenteScreen"

# Expected:
# [EvenimenteScreen] Loaded 10 events from Firestore
# [EvenimenteScreen] Events with isArchived=false: 8
# [EvenimenteScreen] Filtered events count: 5
```
