**Issue:** Timeout not applied to accounts restored from Firestore before deployment.

---

## C) Logs Analysis

**Problem:** Accounts restored from Firestore do NOT have:

1. Event handlers attached (messages.upsert = 0)
2. Connecting timeout set
3. QR generation triggered

**Root Cause:** `restoreAccountsFromFirestore()` creates account objects but doesn't call `createConnection()` properly.

---

## D) Restart Test (NOT COMPLETED)

**Cannot complete G4 restart x3 test because:**

1. Connected account has no event handlers (won't receive messages)
2. Need to fix restoration logic first
3. Manual legacy hosting restart required (no API access)

---

## SUMMARY

### ✅ What Works:

- Backend healthy and running
- Message sending works (tested earlier)
- 1 account shows as CONNECTED
- Timeout code implemented (60s)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work:

- 8 accounts stuck in "connecting forever" (> 2 minutes)
- No QR codes generated for stuck accounts
- Timeout not applied to restored accounts
- Event handlers not attached to restored accounts
- Cannot receive inbound messages

### 🔧 What's Needed:

1. Fix `restoreAccountsFromFirestore()` to properly initialize accounts
2. Attach event handlers when restoring
3. Set connecting timeout when restoring
4. Trigger QR generation for accounts without valid creds
5. Add mode/lock fields to /health endpoint
6. Complete restart x3 test after fixes

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**NOT DONE** - Critical issues remain:

- Accounts stuck in limbo state
- No message reception capability
- Restoration logic broken

**Estimated time to fix:** 1-2 hours
**Priority:** HIGH - blocks production use
